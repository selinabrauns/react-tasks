Environment for react tasks

1) Create a dropdown component.
- Before any option in dropdown is chosen if should say 'Chose option' in head.
- Provide three options: 'Banana', 'Apple' and 'Orange'. Store these as initial state
- After having clicked any option the dropdown should be closed and the head should display the chosen option now.
- It is not necessary to implement a closing behaviour when clicking outside of the dropdown.
