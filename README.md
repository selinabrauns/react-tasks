# react-tasks
Environment for react tasks

You can use this frontend setup to solve the react tasks below. If you use the CSS classnames as described in each task you don't have to care about styling. In case you want to provide an own styling as well a gulp task is taking care of compiling your SCSS to CSS.
Gulp will also take care for compiling your jsx files to js. To see your results just run the index.html in browser. Good luck!

1) Create a dropdown component.
- Before any option in dropdown is chosen if should say 'Chose option' in head.
- Provide three options: 'Banana', 'Apple' and 'Orange'. Store these as initial state
- After having clicked any option the dropdown should be closed and the head should display the chosen option now.
- It is not necessary to implement a closing behaviour when clicking outside of the dropdown.

2) Make the dropdown's options be filter- and editable.
- Create two three components: 1. Use the list from above to display a simple list component 2. A text filter component (input + button) 3. A user input component, where users can add words and add it to the list
